# TSR-with-CNN
**Traffic Sign Recognition with CNN**
A very simple toy case of using CNN to do object classification. This is a mini-class project at SJTU-ParisTech Elite Institut of Technology, from module *Intelligent Vehicles* held by Prof. Hao LI.  

The dataset is GTSRB data set. The architecture is based on LeNet, some very simple modification are done to improve the performence.   

The model is light enough to be run on a PC with CPU.

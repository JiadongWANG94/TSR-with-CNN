# TSR-with-CNN
**Traffic Sign Recognition with CNN**  

A very simple toy case of using CNN to do object classification. This is a mini-class project at SJTU-ParisTech Elite Institut of Technology, from module *Intelligent Vehicles* held by Prof. Hao LI.  

The dataset is [GTSRB](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset) data set. The architecture is based on LeNet, some very simple modification are done to improve the performence.   

The model is light enough to be run on a PC with CPU.
